I've spent more time on Kauai than the other islands but I have suggestions for the major islands except for Oahu which I've only done a day trip on.  

## Kauai

### Things to Do

* Air Tours - Like the other islands, Kauai offers tours by air via either helicopter or fixed wing planes.  There is an active community of locals who are not happy with the helicopters due to the noise and landings.  Fixed wing planes are a nice alternative though you do miss out on the opportunity to land near some more remote waterfalls.
* [Captain Andy's Catamaran Cruises](https://www.napali.com/) - Most of the tours they do leave from Eleele which is a bit of a drive depending on where you're at, but, it's worth it.  I've done the snorkel BBQ cruise twice, going to the Na Pali coast the first time and along the south eastern shore of the island the second time (due to poor weather on the coast).  This is a fun way to see the coast on a big, comfortable catamaran.  There are other options (not quite as many as some of the other islands) but Captain Andy has good service and does a good job.  
* [Kalalua Trail](https://www.kalalautrail.com/) - The Kalalua Trail, on the north side of the island past Hanalei, is famous as one of the best hikes in the world.  It's also a fairly intense hike and there are some pretty strict requirements on hiking it.  The rules were just recently changed in 2019 so it's recommended you look into this one early to try and make sure you're able to hike it when you arrive.  There is a waterfall that is only a few miles in but if you want to make it to the beach at the end, you should plan to start very early or spend the night camping.  This trail is also highly affected by seasons and weather so it's not *hikable by everyone* year round.
* [Na Pali Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81_Pali_Coast_State_Park) - The Na Pali coast is basically the northwest coast of Kauai.  It's undeveloped and mostly a state park which is unaccessible to vehicles and tightly controlled.  The cliffs, or pali, are stunning and should be seen from either the water (a catamaran or zodiac cruise) or the air (helicopter or fixed wing).  You can also kayak into the area but beach landings are highly regulated.
* [Queen's Bath](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g60626-d586624-Reviews-Queen_s_Bath-Princeville_Kauai_Hawaii.html) - Princeville - The head of the trail to this attraction is amidst houses on the north side of the island in Princeville.  Queen's Bath is a natural pool in the volcanic rock that you can swim in.  That said, this *pool* is very exposed and there are frequent waves that go over the rocks into the pool and then pull back water and people.  Due to many people being swept out to sea and dying, the authorities have put up myriad fences around the trail access so your ability to *properly* get to the trail may be limited.  
* [Shops at Kuku'ula](https://www.theshopsatkukuiula.com/) - Poipu - Located close to most of the hotels in Poipu, Kuku'ula has shops of all different types as well as casual dining, more fancy dining, and an upscale grocery store.
* [Sleeping Giant](https://www.hawaii-guide.com/kauai/hiking-trails/sleeping_giant_nounou_mountain_east_trail) - A hiking trail on Kauai with great views from the top.
* [Spouting Horn](https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/kauai/regions/south-shore/spouting-horn) - Poipu - A natural blow hole made from a lava tube, here you can see ocean water spout up to 50 feet in the air.
* [Sunset Golf Cart Tour](https://www.makaigolf.com/sunsetcarttour/) - Princeville - If you're staying in Princeville, this is actually a pretty amazing, and cheap, excursion.  One of the golf course pros will take you, and others, on a golf cart caravan with many fantastic views near sunset.  I wasn't sure about this when we did it but we had a really great time.  
* [Tree Tunnel](https://www.kauai.com/tree-tunnel) - Koloa - One of the most photographed spots on Kauai, the tree tunnel is exactly what it sounds like.  Made from a canopy of Eucalyptus trees, the tunnel isn't quite as impressive as it was years ago prior to Hurricane Iniki ripping several trees away.  Still worth a drive through.  
* [Waimea Canyon](https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/kauai/regions/west-side/waimea-canyon) - The Grand Canyon of Pacific, this canyon offers breathtaking views as you drive up the mountain.  The view from the top at Kalalua Lookout or Pu'u o Kilo Lookout can be absolutely stunning though, depending on the time of year, they can be obscured by fog. 

### Places to Stay

* [Lihue Marriott Resort](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lihhi-kauai-marriott-resort/) - Located close to the airport with beautiful Nawiliwili Bay on the backside, this resort is a great place to stay.  There aren't a lot of things close to the restaurants (a few restaurants and bars off property) but there are several restaurants, expansive pools, and one of the iconic Dukes restaurants, all on the property.  
* [Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/hawaii/grand-hyatt-kauai-resort-and-spa/kauai) - Poipu - This is billed, and priced, as one of the nicest hotels on Kauai.  Walking in the entry and through the lobby with views out to the ocean definitely makes you feel like you've arrived at paradise.  That said, I think this hotel is a bit of a miss.  The pools were incredibly cold when we visited and, after checking in, we found our recently cleaned room to still have dirty towels, an unmade bed, and dirty glasses on the nightstand.  They accommodated us and cleaned it right away, but, I wouldn't have expected that to be an issue at a place like this.  Nice dining options and impressive grounds. 
* [Ko'a Kea](https://meritagecollection.com/koa-kea) - Poipu - As far as the south side of the island goes, this is my favorite hotel that I've stayed at.  It's a bit more upscale and boutiquey than most hotels but both the rooms and the grounds are extremely well done.  The pool has a view of the ocean and you're right on the beach.  The hotel restaurant, Red Salt, is quite good as well.  
* [Marriott Waiohai Beach Club](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lihwi-marriotts-waiohai-beach-club/) - Poipu - Also located in Poipu, right next to the Ko'a Kea, is the Beach Club.  This property feels a bit run down and is definitely more of a family destination. 
* [Princeville Resort](https://www.princevilleresorthawaii.com) - The Princeville Resort, in Princeville, has an interesting history.  For many years it was the Princeville St Regis hotel (since 2007) until it was purchased in 2018 and rebranded as The Princeville Resort.  Current rumors are that some, if not the whole, property will be shut down to renovate again to relaunch under it's new owner's label of "1 Hotels".  While a bit out of the way, this property is fantastic.  The views from the lobby bar of Hanalei bay and the nearby mountains are stunning  The infinity pool overlooking the bay is amazing.  There are assorted dining options as well so you never have to leave if you don't want to.  Make sure you check out the Sunset Golf Cart Tour at the nearby golf course if you're staying here.  

### Restaurants

* [Bar Acuda](http://www.restaurantbaracuda.com/) - Hanalei - Locally sourced tapas and good drinks make this a fun restaurant in Hanalei.
* [Beach House](https://www.the-beach-house.com/menu/) - Poipu - Known for the sunset out the back windows, great service, and excellent food, this restaurant, on the south side of the island, is highly recommended.  Make sure you book a reservation early, ask for a table at the windows, and book the start time to be a bit before sunset.
* [Bubba Burger](https://www.bubbaburger.com/) - Multiple Locations - As close as you're likely to get to fast food, Bubba Burger is a small local burger chain with two locations (they closed their Hanalei location recently).
* [Dukes](https://www.dukeskauai.com/) - Lihue - Dukes is a Hawaii institution with outposts on 3 of the islands, as well as several locations in California.  Named for the famous surfer, Dukes can be relied on to serve up typical Hawaiian dishes and have Hawaiian cocktails and beers on hand.  If you're visiting Hawaii and you haven't been to a Dukes before, I recommend it.  
* [Hukilau Lanai](https://hukilaukauai.com/) - Wailua - Located on the eastern side of the island, Hukilau Lanai is a great restaurant.  Their private room and private group dining options are also great.  Try the poke nachos.  
* [Kalypso Island Bar and Grill](http://www.kalypsokauai.com/) - Hanalei - Possibly best described as a Hawaiian dive, this place serves up good food, including breakfast, and good drinks.  
* Makai Grill - Princeville - This WAS the dinner and fine dining restaurant at the Princeville Resort though it's since closed for renovations.  Hopefully when they open back up they'll still have the pressed salmon sushi.  
* [North Shore General Store](http://pizzakauai.com/) - Princeville - Actually the shop at the gas station at the entrance to Princeville (the same location as the Foodland) this store actually has really great food.  Pick up some breakfast or get a burger or pizza for lunch.  
* [Red Salt](https://meritagecollection.com/koa-kea/dining/red-salt) - Poipu - The hotel restaurant for the Ko'a Kea.  Red Salt serves up upscale, modern Hawaii food and great service.  
* [Tide Pools](https://tidepoolskauai.com/) - Poipu - The nicer restaurant at the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort.  I've eaten here twice and, it's not bad, it's also not amazing.  If you have a window seat you can enjoy a view of the koi pond surrounding the restaurant while you eat.
